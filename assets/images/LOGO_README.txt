UN-Habitat Logo Placeholder Instructions
=========================================

To use the official UN-Habitat logo:

1. Obtain the official UN-Habitat logo from:
   - UN-Habitat Brand Guidelines
   - Your organization's communications department

2. Save the logo as: un_habitat_logo.png
   - Recommended size: 180x60 pixels (or similar aspect ratio)
   - Format: PNG with transparent background

3. Place the file in this folder:
   assets/images/un_habitat_logo.png

4. Update Config.LOGO_PLACEHOLDER to False in app/config.py

IMPORTANT:
- Ensure logo usage complies with UN-Habitat branding permissions
- Do not use unofficial or modified versions of the logo
- Contact UN-Habitat communications for proper logo files

For now, a text-based placeholder is used in the application.
